          I love working with people who are passionate about their work.
          Believing in taking ownership of my actions and constantly pushing
          myself to grow and improve, I work best in an environment where I can
          constantly communicate with stakeholders and take initiative to help
          businesses grow. I seek an opportunity of taking ownership of a
          project and lead a team to success.
